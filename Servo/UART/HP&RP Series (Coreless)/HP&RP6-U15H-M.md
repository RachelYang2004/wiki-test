## 6. Protections

- All protection parameters can be set and modified by our PC configuration tool.

- The status flag bits are defined as follows: 1 represents Protection triggered，0 represents normal operation.

  | ![protection](./UART_image/protection.png) |
  | ------------------------------------------ |

  > [!WARNING]
  >
  > Modification towards any protection parameters may cause
  >
  > damage to the production or affect its normal operation. Please proceed with caution and ensure potential risks are fully assessed before making changes.

### 6.1 Temperature Protection
-  Temperature protection parameter can be set via our PC configuration tool. If the temperature exceeds the threshold, temperature protection will be triggered. 
-  Default value: 70℃.
-  When the temperature protection is triggered, the servo will automatically switch to low-power mode while maintaining basic motion functions. 
-  Check temperature protection bit [bit7] to verify if temperature protection mode is on.
-  When the temperature drops 10°C below the preset protection threshold, the servo will resume normal operation, and the temperature protection bit will be reset to 0.

### 6.2 Voltage Protection
-  High/low voltage protection parameters can be set via our PC configuration tool. If the voltage exceeds the threshold, voltage protection will be triggered.

-  Default values are as follows， 

  - 7.4V version：6.0-8.4V

  - 12V version：9.0-12.6V

  - 24V version：20-25V

- When voltage protection is triggered, the servo will automatically switch to free mode.

- Check voltage protection bit [bit3]/[bit4] to verify if the voltage protection mode is on.

- When the operating voltage is restored to the normal range after rebooted, the servo will resume normal operation.

### 6.3 Stall Protection
- Turn on stall and lock protection；
- Preset the parameter of power protection value. If the value exceeds the threshold, stall protection will be triggered.
- When stall protection is triggered, the servo will automatically switch to free mode.
- Please check stall protection bit [bit2] to verify if the stall protection mode is on.
- When stop command is sent, the servo will resume normal operation.

### 6.4 Power Protection
- Turn off stall and lock protection；
- Preset the parameter of stall power upper limit, which serves as the reference operating power after power protection is triggered.
- Preset the parameter of power protection value. If the value exceeds the threshold, power protection will be triggered.
- When power protection is triggered, the servo will automatically reduce the power to upper limit and keep operating.
- Please check power protection bit [bit6] to verify if the power protection mode is on.

### 6.5 Current Protection
- Preset the current protection parameter. If the value exceeds the threshold, current protection will be triggered.
- When current protection is triggered, the servo will automatically switch to free mode.
- Check current protection bit [bit5] to verify if the current protection mode is on.
- When the operating current is lower than current protection value, the servo will resume normal operation.
- This parameter can be used in conjunction with stall protection or power protection, serving as a safeguard when neither of the two is triggered.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |

- **Multi-turn Position Read**

  Send a multi-turn position read instruction to the servo with the specified ID to receive the data of current position.

- **Multi-turn Position Reset** 

  When the servo is in free mode , the current position data can be reset through our exclusive software or a designated instruction.

  After resetting, the servo will reset the position based on its current absolute position, and the initial value of the position will be in the range of -180° to +180° again.

For example: as shown in the figure, the current position at point A1 is 6,880°, and position will be θ1 after resetting. The current position at point A2 is 6,800°, and position will be -θ2 after resetting.

| <img src="./UART_image/多圈重置.png" alt="多圈重置" style="zoom:67%;" /> |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |

- **Power-off Position Retention**

  Our product supports power-off position retention function.

  After power-off, if the servo 's position has not changed, the current position value after power-on will remain unchanged.

  For example: The position value of point A is 6,800° before power-off. If the position does not change during power-off and the remains at point A, the position value after power-on will still be 6,800°. 

  After power-off, if the servo's position is moved externally, the post-power-on position will remain within ±180° of the retained position.

  For example: As shown in the figure, the position value of point A is 6,800° before power-off. If the is rotated by an external force during power-off and stops at point B1, the position value after power-on will be 6,920°; if it stops at point B2, the position value will be 6,680°.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |

### 7.8 Damping Mode[9]

- The servo is allowed to adjust to different positions under external force while maintaining a certain damping effect. 
-  The damping coefficient can be customized.

### 7.9 Stop Instructions[24]

- Customers can choose the appropriate stop instruction type based on different motion control needs. The specific types detailed in the table below. 
- Stop instruction can also be used to restore normal operation of a servo under stall protection.
- When the servo is in free mode, sending a "Lock Mode" instruction can re-establish locking force from its current position.

| Type         | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free Mode    | The servo stops moving immediately and releases the locking force. |
| Lock Mode    | The servo stops moving immediately and holds the locking force, or restores the locking force in the non‑locking state. |
| Damping Mode | The servo stops moving immediately and enters damping mode, and the position can be adjusted by external force. |

### 7.10 Synchronous Instruction[25]

- A single instruction contains the control instructions of multiple servos at the same time, which is suitable for the scenario of multiple servos working together.
- Each servo matches the parameters in the instruction content through a unique ID, and only parses and responds to the control information related to its own ID.
- After receiving the instruction, all servo s will start to execute their respective instructions at the same time to achieve the effect of synchronous action.

### 7.11 Asynchronous Instruction[18] [19]

- The asynchronous instruction consists of two parts: the asynchronous write instruction and the asynchronous execution instruction. 
- After sending the asynchronous write instruction, the motion instruction to be executed is sent and temporarily stored in the register of the corresponding ID servo . This motion instruction is not executed immediately—it requires a separate asynchronous execution instruction to trigger execution uniformly.
- When the asynchronous execution instruction is sent, all servo s with stored motion instructions will execute their corresponding actions simultaneously, achieving synchronized control of multiple servo s. 
- The stored motion instruction will remain intact unless overwritten by a new instruction or power is disconnected. It will not be overwritten or cleared by the execution of other instructions.
- After the asynchronous instruction is triggered for execution, the related parameters are automatically cleared and no longer retained.

### 7.12 Parameter Customization

- The parameters of servo in the table below all support single read[03], write[04], and reset[02].
- It is recommended to use our PC configuration tool for setting.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Any modification in parameters may damage the product or affect its normal operation. Please proceed with caution and ensure potential risks are fully assessed before making changes.
