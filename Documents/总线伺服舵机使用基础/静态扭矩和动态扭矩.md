# Static Torque vs Dynamic Torque: Analysis of Key Differences

In mechanical design and control system development, static torque and dynamic torque are two important concepts. Understanding their differences is crucial for selecting and using servos. This article will elaborate on the definitions, functions, and key differences of static torque and dynamic torque, so as to better apply these concepts in practical projects.

## Static Torque

**Static Torque** (also known as Holding Torque) refers to the torque required by a servo to maintain a specific position when the mechanical system is at rest. This torque is mainly used to resist external loads and prevent the robotic arm or other components from moving.

- **Application Scenarios**: Static torque is typically applied in situations where a fixed position needs to be maintained for a long time. For example, a joint of a robotic arm needs to remain stationary for a long time during operation.

- **Calculation Method:** Under ideal conditions, ignoring the weight of the connecting rod, the calculation of static torque when the rocker arm is horizontal is relatively simple. For example, when the servo is placed horizontally and the load weight is m, the static torque is the maximum. It can be described by the formula:
